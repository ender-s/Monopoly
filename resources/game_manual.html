                    Number of players are asked at the beginning of the game.
                    <br />
                    Number of players have to be between 2 and 8 (inclusive).
                    <br />
                    Names of players and the initial money amount are asked.
                    <br />
                    At the beginning of the game, each player rolls dice, and the player that has rolled the greatest number starts the game.
                    <br />
                    - If more than one player rolls the greatest number, these players again roll dice among themselves. This process goes on until there is one player remaining that has rolled the greatest number.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    After determining the starter, the game starts with the starter player rolling dice.

                <h2 style="color: red">There are 11 different field types in the game:</h2>

                <h2 style="color: blue">1 - Free Parking</h2>
                <p>
                    - When players pay tax, the tax that have been paid is put here.<br />
                    - When players go bankruptcy not because they owe other players but because they cannot pay tax, all money of them is put here.<br />
                    - When players come here, they earn money that is accumulated here.<br />
                    - Free Parking area cannot be owned, sold, nor bought.<br />
                    - Neither a hotel nor a house can be built on this area.<br />
                </p>

                <br />
                <br />
                
                <h2 style="color: blue">2 - Public Service</h2>
                <p>
                    - These areas make their owner earn a predetermined amount of money each turn.<br />
                    - The amount of money that these areas make their owner earn is a constant amount.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;That is, these amounts do not change when the number of public service areas that the owner has changes.
                    <br />
                    - They can be bought or sold.
                    <br />
                    - Hotels and houses cannot be built on this areas.
                    <br />
                </p>
                
                <br />
                <br />
                
                <h2 style="color: blue">3 - Land</h2>
                <p>
                    - Lands can be bought or sold. Hotels and houses can be built on lands.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - When players come to a land, they have to pay required amount of rent to the owner of the land.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;If a player that comes here does not have enough money to pay the rent, then the player is out of the game and all properties that this player has is owned by the owner of the land.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of rent for a land changes according to the number of houses/hotels on the land.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - At most 4 houses can be built on a land. For a house to be built on a land, the owner must own all lands in the same color group.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Also, number of houses on a land must increase equally.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if there are 1, 1, and 2 houses on three lands in the same color group respectively, a third house cannot be built on any land in that color group before the second houses are built on the lands where there is 1 house.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The same rule also holds for hotels. No hotel can be built on a land before 4 houses are built on all the lands in the same color group.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - A player can build 2 houses on the same land in one turn.
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;However, the condition of balanced house increase must be satisfied beforehand.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;That is, assume that there are 1, 2, and 2 houses, respectively, on three lands in the same color group.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The player can increase the number of house to 2 by building a house on the land where there is 1 house.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Then, since this does not violate balanced increase principle, the player can have 3, 2, 2 houses, respectively, on these lands by building one more house on the same land.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - When a player can build a hotel/house on a land, this does not mean that the player has to build a hotel/house.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The player can pass the turn without building anything.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - When a land is sold, it is sold together with the houses/hotel on it.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The case where the land and the buildings on it are sold separately is not possible.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of a land also owns the buildings on that land.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - A house and a hotel cannot exist on the same land at the same time.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;When a hotel is built on a land where there are 4 houses, all the houses get destroyed and the hotel takes place of houses.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - A hotel cannot be destroyed after it is built. Houses can only be destroyed when a hotel takes place of 4 houses.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - The lands are given to its new owner together with the buildings on it when it is sold, or when a player takes all properties of another player that could not pay their debt.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;If the player goes bankruptcy without owing any other player, then the lands that the player owns become unowned together with all buildings on them.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;A land that have become unowned can be bought by a player that comes on the land by paying its current price.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Price of a land on which there is house/hotel is greater than the price of the empty state of the same land.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - Price for building a hotel or a house is derived from the price of the empty state of the land and is constant throughout the game.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;That is, price for building house/hotel does not change when the number of houses on the land changes.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - There can exist at most 1 hotel on a land.
                </p>
